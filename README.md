# BIOS900-Linear-Models
This project presents practices I have done on the Survival Analysis class.<br />
I have included all four homework assignments, one take home midterm exam. <br />
The final project will be presented in a separate repository.<br />
The solution is typed in latex and the code is done with SAS.<br />
The textbook is "Survival Analysis-Springer: Second Edition- John P.Klein and Melvin L. Moeschberger."
